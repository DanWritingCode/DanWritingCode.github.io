## What is FastAI
[Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/about.html) is an open-source library built on [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), [blog](https://www.fast.ai/), [forum](https://forums.fast.ai/) and [educational platform](https://www.fast.ai/#category=courses) focused on making deep learning.

The course the most helped me understand about deep learning was [Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2022-07-21-dl-coders-22.html) taught by Jeremy Howard and based on a freely available [book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/).

Although I have not yet been through all 9 lessons I have made progress on the following:

- [x] Getting started
- [x] Deployment
- [x] Neural net foundations
- [ ] Natural Language (NLP)
- [ ] From-scratch model
- [ ] Random forests
- [ ] Collaborative filtering and embeddings
- [ ] Convolutions (CNNs)
