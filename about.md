My name is Daniel Uy I am a student at The University of Queensland studing a Masters of Electrical Engineering. As part of my studies I have enrolled in ELEC4602 which focuses on image processing and machine learning.

This page was created with the aim of improving my learning by blogging about what I've learned and how I have solved problems while exploring git and Github.
